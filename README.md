#  Bayesian Network Parser for .bif file 
As the title suggests, this project contains a useful JAVA parser for building [Bayesian Network](https://github.com/aimacode/aima-java/blob/AIMA3e/aima-core/src/main/java/aima/core/probability/bayes/BayesianNetwork.java) from a .bif file.

:warning: :warning: :warning: **PLEASE, PAY ATTENTION: a bif file has the CPTs sorted in a wrong way and I haven't implemented a method that sorts them yet, so you HAVE TO sort manually CPTs on BIF file, thank you for comprehension.**

:warning: **I'm sorry but javadocs are actually missing, I'll add them as soon as a I can.**
